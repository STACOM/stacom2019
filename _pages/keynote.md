Prof. Sotirios A. Tsaftaris, obtained his PhD and MSc degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from Northwestern University, USA in 2006 and 2003 respectively. He obtained his Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

Currently, he is Canon Medical/Royal Academy of Engineering Research Chair in Healthcare AI, and Chair in Machine Learning and Computer Vision at the University of Edinburgh (UK). He is also a Turing Fellow with the Alan Turing Institute. Previously he was an Assistant Professor with IMT Institute for Advanced Studies, Lucca, Italy and Director of the Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis Unit at IMT (2011-2015). Prior to that, he held a joint Research Assistant Professor appointment at Northwestern University with the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Radiology Feinberg School of Medicine (2006-2011).

He is an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics. He is tutorial chair for ECCV 2020. He was Doctoral Symposium Chair for IEEE ICIP 2018 (Athens). He served as area chair for IEEE ICME 2019, MICCAI 2018, ICCV 2017, MMSP 2016, and VCIP 2015. He has also co-organized workshops for CVPR (2019), ICCV (2017), ECCV (2014), BMVC (2015, 2018), and MICCAI (2016, 2017). He has received the best paper award (STACOM 2017), twice the Magna Cum Laude Award (ISMRM in 2012 and 2014), and was a finalist for the Early Career Award (Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, SCMR, in 2011 and 2019). He has authored more than 140 journal and conference papers particularly in interdisciplinary Ô¨Åelds and his work is (or has been) supported by the National Institutes of Health (USA), EPSRC & BBSRC (UK), the European Union, and several non-profits and industrial partners.

His research interests are in machine learning, computer vision, image analysis (medical image computing and in particular cardiovascular MR image analysis), and image processing.

Dr. Tsaftaris is a Murphy, Onassis, and Marie Curie Fellow. He is also member of IEEE, ISMRM, SCMR, and IAPR.
