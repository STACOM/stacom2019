|**8:35-9:15** | **Disentangled representation learning in medical imaging**<br>Keynote speaker: Professor Sotirios A. Tsaftaris (University of Edinburgh, UK)<br><br>![image-left]({{ "/images/sotos.jpg" | relative_url }}){: style="width: 100px; float: left; border-radius: 30%; margin-right: 10px;"}The detection of disease, segmentation of anatomy and other classical analysis tasks, have seen incredible improvements due to deep learning. Yet these advances need lots of data: for every new task, new modality, new hospital more training data are needed. In this talk, I will show how deep neural networks can learn latent and disentangled embeddings suitable for several analysis tasks in the heart. Within a multi-task learning setting I will show that the same framework can learn embeddings drawing supervision from self-supervised tasks that use reconstruction and also temporal dynamics overall reducing considerably need for annotation. I will discuss how different architectural choices can solve key problems in multimodal data processing and critically also allow us to learn reducing need for image-level annotations by obtaining supervision also from text-based health records. I will conclude by highlighting challenges for deep learning in healthcare in general.
